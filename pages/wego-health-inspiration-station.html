		<p>WEGO Health hosts the annual Health Activists Awards. Community members endorse and connect with other like minded individuals across several patient-centric categories. The event has proven very successful.</p>

	<article>
		<p>Over the years, several designers have contributed to the project, each imparting a new aesthetic or methodology, resulting in a fragmented experience. I was tasked with redesigning the user interface and experience.v</p>

		<h3>BEFORE</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>There was a lack of cohesiveness in the overall design. The content took up nearly 100% of the viewport, which caused a cluttered and busy look. Also, there was no adherence to the underlying grid system, which is a drain on Engineering resources.</li>
			<li>There were two sets of navigation at the top of the page in direct competition to each other. Also, several pages utilized an infinite scroll (for a finite group of people) was used and didn’t allow users access to use the footer navigation.</li>
			<li>Each page had a different aesthetic and lacked proper hierarchy. Some pages were largely white, others a textured gray, and still others that were very vibrant.</li>

		<h3>AFTER</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Using the Web Inspector, I found the client was using Twitter Bootstrap. The Bootstrap grid system was used for the re-design, removing extemporaneous markup and CSS.</li>
			<li>A prominent sign in/sign up links replaced the set of cherry-picked navigation, creating clarity the the header. </li>
			<li>WEGO used “cards” in a smart way across several pages. However, the use of the infinite scroll, a drain on users and load times, was unsucessful. The size and elements of the cards was standardized to level the “playing field” for nominees and judges, removing bias.</li>
			<li>A formal aesthetic was created and used across all pages. The layout of the cards was slightly differentiated, but used many of the same elements. White cards on top of a textured gray background provided proper contrast of the foreground and background. </li>
