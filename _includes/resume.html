                  <h5>Leadership</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>I often serve as the initial point of contact for new employees, assisting with their onboarding by answering questions, providing training, and introducing them to colleagues, which has contributed to faster onboarding, a breakdown of silos, and better collaboration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Culture Keepers task force member:</strong> Integrate recently opened a new office in India and diverged into two business units, requiring a cultural mindset. The task force designed surveys segmented by location, group, and role to gain an understanding of employee sentiment.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI task force member:</strong> researched, recommended, and  implemented AI tools that improved quality and accelerated time to delivery throughout our design process:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Maze AI</strong> for product research that automatically analyzes testing data to drive insights and accelerate analysis by 40%.</li>
                      <li>With <strong>EightShapes</strong>, designers and developers have seen a 60% time savings when creating and inspecting specs.</li>
                      <li><strong>Design Lint</strong> has improved adherence to the product's defined styles and patterns, resulting in a consistent product experience. Additionally, I spend 70% less time manually checking design files.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>Design System Lead</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Facilitated workshops to establish <strong>design system operating principles</strong> prioritizing community and use cases over "snowflakes." This approach led to less rework, streamlined decision-making, greater team alignment, and consistent product experiences.</li>
                    <li>Drove a series of training sessions that up-skilled designers in design system and Figma best practices that resulted in standardized component architectures and a <strong>streamlined designer/developer workflow experience</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Developed and maintained a design system roadmap</strong> in sync with all product roadmaps to build components aligned with the company's strategic priorities, enabling implementation teams to deliver features at scale.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implemented a governance decision tree document and an Atlassian service desk</strong> that provides clear guidance and process for component requests, which resulted in improved team communication, reduced instances of duplicate components, and better data to properly prioritize the design system backlog.</li>
                    <li><strong>Led design reviews</strong>, provided feedback, and identified new or enhanced components. Highlighted inconsistencies, tracked dependencies, and documented decisions to support component backlog planning.</li>
                    <li>Collaborated with our development team to <strong>create a design system documentation template</strong> that provides self-serve design guidelines and specifications. As a result, we have seen improved team efficiency, alignment, adherence to design standards, and a higher-quality user experience.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight-text">Led design and research to redesign product navigation</span> using familiar labels from open card sorting, aligning with user goals and boosting adoption. I reduced navigation levels for faster content access, enhancing usability and engagement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Championed a new action bar feature with saved views</strong>, filters, and sorting options, delivering a personalized product experience that boosts workflow efficiency and productivity.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>Interim Design Leader (9 months)</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Expanded the team from 3 to 7 designers across the US and India, hiring to fill skills gaps and bring in comparable experience.</li>
                    <li>Elevated the team's maturity from emergent (functional but inconsistent and inefficient) to structured (partly systematic, variably effective) by implementing micro-learning, tracking team-level work, and conducting daily stand-ups and monthly retrospectives. </li>
                    <li>Mentored designers in project management, communication, presentation, and stakeholder management.</li>
                    <li>Collaboratively designed a new product vision through usability testing, consumer advisory boards, and feedback sessions with internal and enterprise customers.</li>
