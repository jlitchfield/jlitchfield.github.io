                  <h6 class="category">Leadership</h6>
                  <ul>
                    <li>I often serve as the initial point of contact for new employees, assisting with their onboarding by answering questions, providing training, and introducing them to colleagues, which has contributed to faster onboarding, a breakdown of silos, and better collaboration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Culture Keepers task force member:</strong> Integrate recently opened a new office in India and diverged into two business units, requiring a cultural mindset. The task force designed surveys segmented by location, group, and role to gain an understanding of employee sentiment.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI task force member:</strong> researched, recommended, and  implemented AI tools that improved quality and accelerated time to delivery throughout our design process:</li>

                    <li>Drove a series of training sessions that up-skilled designers in design system and Figma best practices that resulted in standardized component architectures and a <strong>streamlined designer/developer workflow experience</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Developed and maintained a design system roadmap</strong> in sync with all product roadmaps to build components aligned with the company's strategic priorities, enabling implementation teams to deliver features at scale.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implemented a governance decision tree document and an Atlassian service desk</strong> that provides clear guidance and process for component requests, which resulted in improved team communication, reduced instances of duplicate components, and better data to properly prioritize the design system backlog.</li>
                    <li><strong>Led design reviews</strong>, provided feedback, and identified new or enhanced components. Highlighted inconsistencies, tracked dependencies, and documented decisions to support component backlog planning.</li>
