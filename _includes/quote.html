            <h3>Thank you Joshua,</h3><br>
            <blockquote class="has-dropcap"><span class="dropcap"></span>Thank you for the <strong>guidance, freedom and the opportunity</strong> to do everything I did so far to <strong>increase design awareness</strong> in the organization here. The India team has had a <strong>major shift</strong> and now includes design in conversations after a lot of evaluation. I'm glad you let me lead this by consistent discovery, bringing perspectives and identify user, business and product goals in every single product line I am a part of.<br><br>
            <strong>Thank you most importantly for trusting me to make progress with the team here.</strong> The transparency in the design team in the last few quarters was phenomenal and encouraged each of one us to truly understand the product and question things, gently. I hope we can continue to bring that to our team and take charge where necessary and halt and guide when needed, which <strong>under your leadership, was truly a great success.</strong>
